## As a user, I would like my data to persistently track totals between page refreshes, so that I can keep track of the aggregate number of votes.

- Implement local storage into your current application
- Make sure the data persists across both browser refreshes and resets

### Hints:

- Store the products array into local storage as a formatted JSON string

- Retrieve the products array from local storage and then utilize the JSON.parse() function. Remember, if your constructor utilizes prototype methods, you will have to send each item in the array back through the constructor function.

## Run a Lighthouse Accessbility report. Make necessary updates to your application based on the report to get your score above 80.

- Add a screenshot of your score to your README.md file.
