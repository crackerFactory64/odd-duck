## As a marketeer, I want to prevent users from seeing the same image in two subsequent iterations, so that they are not biased.

- Update your algorithm to randomly generate three unique product images from the images directory.
- Update your algorithm so that new products are generated, confirm that these products are not duplicates from the immediate previous set.

## As a marketing manager, I would like a visual representation of how many times a product was clicked so that I can visually analyze the results.

- Using ChartJS (imported from CDN), display the vote totals and the number of times a product was viewed in a bar chart format. (hint: donâ€™t forget about the <canvas> tags)
- Place the bar chart in the section located beneath your three product images
- The bar charts should only appear after all voting data has been collected.

## Run a Lighthouse Accessbility report. Make necessary updates to your application based on the report to get your score above 80.

- Add a screenshot of your score to your README.md file.

## Stretch Goals

- Try some additional charting types based off of some of the other data you collected and display them in addition to the required bar chart
